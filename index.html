            More than 2 years of professional experience in Python, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Research. All my projects are available on the internet and can be viewed in my resume. Additionally, I have experience in Git, Cmake, Docker, web scraping, Linux, bash, C++, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming.
        </p>

            At my last workplace at the TÜBİTAK research organization, I worked as a researcher developing novel computer vision deep learning models. I have a total of 4 projects that are published online and that were presented at the international conferences and journals in the United States of America, Germany, Indonesia and Turkey. In my last work, I have proposed a novel lightweight Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for medical image generation along with an extensive dataset for medical image segmentation.

            I have developed several console, web, and desktop applications as my personal projects. For instance, in my latest project I developed a client-server application for instant messaging. I utilized C++ and several libraries including ASIO for networking, OpenSSL for end-to-end encryption and decryption, GLFW, ImGui, and stb for the client-side GUI application, and SQLite3 for database management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application comprises a server-side, which is run locally on my Raspberry Pi SBC, and is responsible for ensuring safe real-time intercommunication between clients with end-to-end encryption and decryption, storage of chat history, and connections. On the other hand, the client-side includes a GUI part and a TCP connection with the server, which are run concurrently. In another latest project, I have developed a C++ GUI file manager application available on Linux and Windows. Additionally, I have other projects in C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python that are available in my CV. 
        </p>

            I am always motivated to learn something new, and I am confident that this trait will help me to contribute a lot to your company. As part of my bachelor’s degree, I studied Mathematical Engineering at International Information Technologies University in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where I have acquired such skills as programming in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. In addition, I have a solid mathematical background. During my master’s degree, I studied Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Bahçeşehir University in Istanbul, Turkey. As a result, I extended my knowledge in programming and artificial intelligence.
